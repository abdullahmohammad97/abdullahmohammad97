# 👋 Hey, I'm Abdullah

Thanks for stopping by!
Let me introduce myself I’m Abdullah Mohammad, a recent MSc Management with Data Analytics graduate, also holding a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I’ve always been curious about how things work, especially what makes some ideas succeed while others don’t. That curiosity turned into a habit of tracking patterns, solving problems, and testing ideas early on.

At 15 years old, I still remember that time when I had a first look at an actual chart — a Forex chart — and by just looking at it, I felt like it was telling a story in numbers, that something was happening (even though I understood nothing). But as time passed and I grew up, I started experimenting online with everything. I had no idea why, but I developed a strong interest in solving problems through writing (CODING) at that age. I got my hands on anything I could like selling gadgets, creating affiliate pages, running theme pages and drive and convert the traffic into an actual sales, offering review services for Amazon, and even reverse engineering what made successful online stores tick. Later on, I also started multiple small online campaigns for different products and worked as a product tester for Amazon. I didn’t realise it back then, but I was already thinking like an analyst, looking for the “why” behind results.

Eventually, I started using Excel to track sales and spot trends. Then came dashboards. Then a full blown obsession with data. I taught myself tools like Power BI, Python, and SQL to make sense of messy, real-world datasets and to find insights that actually mattered.

That passion eventually led me to pursue a degree in Data Analysis, building on the self taught foundation I had been growing for years.

# 📊 What I Do Now
These days, I focus on solving real world problems using data. My approach always starts with two questions:
“What story is this data telling me?” and “What problem is this business really facing?”

🔹 Clean, explore, and analyse large datasets
🔹 Build dashboards & reports using Power BI & Excel
🔹 Forecast trends and identify business opportunities
🔹 Run A/B tests, track KPIs, and improve decision making
🔹 Apply machine learning models to uncover deeper insights
🔹 Automate repetitive workflows using Python

# 🧠 Machine Learning Skills
To go beyond visualisations and reporting, I’ve been building a foundation in machine learning applying predictive techniques to add even more value to business insights.

🧪 Regression (Linear, Logistic)
🔍 Classification (SVM, Decision Trees, KNN)
📊 Model evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
🧹 Data preprocessing and feature engineering
🧠 Tools: scikit-learn, statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib

# 🛠️ Tools & Languages I Use
**Programming & Machine Learning:**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
SQL, MySQL

# **Visualisation & Reporting:**
Power BI
Excel (Advanced formulas, dashboards, forecasting)
Seaborn, Matplotlib
PowerPoint (for Power BI background design)

# **Other Tools:**
Jupyter Notebook
Git & GitHub
Google Sheets

# 🔁 The Real Turning Point
The biggest shift for me was realising that data isn’t just about numbers it’s about stories, strategies, and smarter decisions. Whether I was tracking product trends or analysing patterns in mental health data, I kept chasing the meaning behind the numbers.

And that’s still the mindset I carry today:
Curious. Problem focused. Outcome driven.
