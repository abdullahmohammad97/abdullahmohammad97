# 👋 Hey, I'm Abdullah

Thanks for stopping by!

I didn’t take the “traditional” route into data analysis, my journey started much earlier and, frankly, a lot messier. At **15 years old**, I was kneedeep in trying anything and everything online: from the first time I saw a forex chart (and understood almost nothing), to selling gadgets, creating affiliate pages, experimenting with product glitches, offering review services, and keeping an eye on other online stores to figure out what made them successful.

Back then, I was just experimenting. But over time, I realised something: I loved solving problems. I loved spotting patterns. And most of all, I loved coding and discovering **why** things work especially when you apply analysis before jumping into a project or business idea.

That curiosity led me to start using **Excel** to track sales and trends. Then came dashboards. Then came a full-blown obsession with **data**. I taught myself how to use tools like **Power BI** and **Python**, how to write queries in **SQL** and **MySQL**, and how to extract real insights from messy, real world data. Eventually, that passion turned into something more structured, and I chose to pursue a **degree in Data Analysis** to sharpen the skills I had already been building independently.

## 📊 What I Do Now:

These days, I focus on solving real world problems using data. My approach always starts with two questions:  
**“What story is this data telling me?”** and **“What problem is this business really facing?”**

🔹 Clean, explore, and analyse large datasets  
🔹 Build dashboards & reports using **Power BI & Excel**  
🔹 Forecast trends and identify business opportunities  
🔹 Run A/B tests, track KPIs, and improve decision making  
🔹 Apply **machine learning models** to uncover deeper insights  
🔹 Automate repetitive workflows using Python

## 🧠 Machine Learning Skills

To go beyond visualisation and reporting, I’ve been developing my foundation in **machine learning** — applying predictive techniques to add even more value to business insights.

- 🧪 Regression (Linear, Logistic)  
- 🔍 Classification (SVM, Decision Trees, KNN)  
- 📊 Model evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)  
- 🧹 Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- 🧠 Tools: `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`

## 🛠️ Tools & Languages I Use:

**Programming & Machine Learning:**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)  
- SQL, MySQL  

**Visualisation & Reporting:**  
- Power BI  
- Excel (Advanced formulas, dashboards, forecasting)  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- PowerPoint (for Power BI background design)

**Other Tools:**  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub  
- Google Sheets

## 🔁 The Real Turning Point

The biggest shift for me was realising that **data isn’t just about numbers**, it’s about stories, strategies and making better decisions. Whether I was tracking product trends or analysing patterns in mental health data, I found myself searching for the **meaning behind the data**.

And that’s still the mindset I carry today:  
Curious. Problem focused. Outcome driven.
