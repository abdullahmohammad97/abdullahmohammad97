# 👋 Hey, I'm Abdallah

Thanks for stopping by!

I'm someone who didn’t take the “traditional” path into data analysis, mine started way earlier and much messier. At **15 years old**, I was knee deep in trying out anything and everything online: from first time seeing a forex chart and scanning and understanding pretty much nothing, to selling gadgets, building affiliate pages, testing product glitches, offering review services, and spying on online stores just to figure out what made them tick.

Back then, I was just experimenting. But over time, I realized something: I loved solving problems. I loved tracking patterns. And most of all I loved coding and understanding **why** things worked the way they did.

That curiosity led me to start using **Excel** to track sales and trends. Then came dashboards. Then came the obsession with **data**. I taught myself how to use tools like **Power BI** and **Python**, how to write queries in **SQL** and **MySQL**, and how to pull real insights from messy information. Eventually, that passion turned into something bigger and I decided to pursue a **degree in Data Analysis** to sharpen the skills I had already started developing in the real world.

## 📊 What I Do Now:

I now work on solving real-world problems using data. My focus is always: “what story is this data telling me?” & "what problem is that business facing?"

🔹 Clean, explore, and analyze large datasets  
🔹 Build dashboards & reports using **Power BI & Excel**  
🔹 Forecast trends and identify business opportunities  
🔹 Run A/B tests, track KPIs, and optimize decisions  
🔹 Apply **machine learning models** to uncover deeper patterns  
🔹 Automate repetitive workflows using Python

## 🧠 Machine Learning Skills

I’ve been building my foundation in **machine learning** to go beyond dashboards and into **predictive analysis**. Some of the concepts I’ve worked with include:

- 🧪 Regression (Linear, Logistic)  
- 🔍 Classification (SVM, Decision Trees, KNN)  
- 📊 Model evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)  
- 🧹 Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- 🧠 Tools: `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`

## 🛠️ Tools & Languages I Use:

**Programming & ML:**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn,)  
- SQL, MySQL  

**Visualization & Reporting:**  
- Power BI  
- Excel (Advanced formulas, Dashboards, Forecasting)  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Power Point for Power BI background creation

**Other Tools:**  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub  
- Google Sheets

## 🔁 The Real Turning Point

What really changed things for me was realizing that **data wasn’t just about numbers** it was about stories, strategies, and smarter decisions. Whether I was tracking product trends or trying to understand mental health patterns in a dataset, I always found myself looking for **meaning** in the chaos.

And that’s the mindset I carry now:  
Curious. Problem-focused. Outcome-driven.
